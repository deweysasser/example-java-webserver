example-java-webserver
======================

A trivial example of a web server in Java

This should *NOT* be used as a large production or publicly facing web
server.

You might find this useful to experiment with web servers or to create
a mock web server for unit/integration testing purposes or to
prototype a system before creating a better system, perhaps based on
Jetty or something like
[these](http://java-source.net/open-source/web-servers).
